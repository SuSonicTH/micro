# micro config

my config directory for the [micro editor](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro)

micro is a terminal-based text editor that aims to be easy to use and intuitive, while also taking advantage of the capabilities of modern terminals. It comes as a single, batteries-included, static binary with no dependencies; you can download and use it right now!

This is more to keep a backup for myself and to be able to easily transport my settings to other machines but you are free to use it yourself
